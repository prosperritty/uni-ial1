# IAL 1. homework
The goal of this homework is to practically use knowledge to implement the following data structures:
- `c201` Singly Linked List
- `c203` Queue (array)
- `c206` Doubly Linked List
- `c206-ext` Practical application of Doubly Linked List

### Evaluation 10/10

# Singly Linked List
- `List_Dispose` Free whole list
- `List_Init` Initialize list 
- `List_InsertFirst` Insert at the beginning of the list
- `List_First` Make first element active
- `List_GetFirst` Get value of first element
- `List_DeleteFirst` Delete element at the beginning of the list
- `List_DeleteAfter` Delete element after active element
- `List_InsertAfter` Insert after active element
- `List_GetValue` Get value of active element
- `List_SetValue` Set new value of active element
- `List_Next` Make active next element to current active element
- `List_IsActive` 小hecks if there is an active element

# Queue
- `Queue_Init` Initialize queue
- `Queue_IsEmpty` 小hecks if queue is empty
- `Queue_IsFull` 小hecks if queue is full
- `Queue_Front` Get value of first element
- `Queue_Remove` Remove first element
- `Queue_Dequeue` Get value of first element and remove it
- `Queue_Enqueue` Insert element at the end of the queue

# Doubly Linked List
- `DLL_Init` Initialize list
- `DLL_Dispose` Free whole list
- `DLL_InsertFirst` Insert at the beginning of the list
- `DLL_InsertLast` Insert at the end of the list
- `DLL_First` Make first element active
- `DLL_Last` Make last element active
- `DLL_GetFirst` Get value of first element
- `DLL_GetLast` Get value of last element
- `DLL_DeleteFirst` Delete element at the beginning of the list
- `DLL_DeleteLast` Delete element at the end of the list
- `DLL_DeleteAfter` Delete element after active element
- `DLL_DeleteBefore` Delete element before active element
- `DLL_InsertAfter` Insert after active element
- `DLL_InsertBefore` Insert before active element
- `DLL_GetValue` Get value of active element
- `DLL_SetValue` Set new value of active element
- `DLL_Previous` Make active previous element to current active element
- `DLL_Next` Make active next element to current active element
- `DLL_IsActive` 小hecks if there is an active element

# Doubly Linked List (Extended)
This part of the homework uses Doubly Linked List to implement receiving and sending packets with a certain priority.
